## About us
We are a team of 4 students attending ChasAcademy. We were tasked to build a front and backend website that had to follow a few requirements.

### The requirements
We had to meet the following technical criteria:

1. **Backend & Database**
   - Build an API using ASP.NET Web API.  
   - Include at least three CRUD endpoints.  
   - Use Entity Framework Core with Code-First.

2. **Web Application**
   - Create an ASP.NET MVC app that consumes the API.  
   - Include at least three views that fetch/display data from the API.

3. **AI & External APIs**
   - Integrate OpenAI via Azure in the API.  
   - Use the AI response inside the application (e.g., analysis, text or image generation).

4. **Tracking & Metadata**
   - Implement Google Analytics or similar event tracking.  
   - Add SEO-related metadata.

5. **Deploy & CI/CD**
   - Publish the application to Azure.  
   - Set up a CI/CD pipeline that builds and deploys automatically.

6. **Version Control**
   - Use GitHub for collaboration and versioning.

7. **Testing**
   - Use xUnit, NUnit, or similar.  
   - Ensure tests run through the GitHub CI/CD pipeline.

8. **Code Quality & Best Practices**
   - Follow a clear architecture (Controller-Service-Repository).  
   - Write clean, well-structured, and commented code.



### The issues.
The issues we ran into most was time-crunches, and azure deployment. Other than that we didn't run into any major issues
